## Motivations

Being a backend developer as well as a photographer,
it is kind of a shame that in 2016 I still do not have
my own website / blog. It is kind of an hurry to get
started.

## Basics

Obviously, I am a backend developer, not a front end one
and feel a bit disapointed when it comes to tackle javascript
and HTML.

From what I have seen and heard until today there are plenty
ways of achieving my goal:

### CMS
- drupal
- wordpress
- joomla
- some more based on rails

Obviously, I do not want to bother in running my own database for
quite static pages. I am not a great publisher and, well say it, I
prefer keyboard and raw text than mouse and IHM when it comes to edit
content.

Moreover, I have tried earlier on to start a drupal and a wordpress CMS,
It always failed, not having enough energy to dive into the complexity of
what should I do to post a simple page and article

### All-In-One websites

- 1 and 1 pages
- wix

Kind of the same thing as CMS, except there is no formal need to maintain your own
server. Plus, I noticed some high latency on wix. I want a fast website, we are in 2016
with high / very high speed connections, I prefer using them for my content.

### Static pages

- write your own
- gohugo
- jekyll

Writing my own sounds a bit like a back to the 80's than a real proper solution.
[gohugo](https://gohugo.io/) sounds pretty nice and will most probably allow me to
address on of my requests: Have an efficient experience with the website. I don't want
to loose my visitor's time waiting for sql queries or php to deign answer #troll. Plus
it is written in some language I would like to try: [go](https://golang.org). But
I would still need to host my frontend. I then tought of the github pages so amazing that
github is not only a git holder but allows to host documentation and sites as well. Let's
give it a try. Reading at the documentation, it appears that [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/)
uses jekyll as page generator engine.

Give it a try!
